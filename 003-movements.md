# Movements
*for Shaz, heading to snow country*

we haven't found all five yet.\
but here's what we know so far:

someone says your name.\
someone checks the weather\
at a building they've never been outside of.\
someone writes a song\
about a laundromat they found at 2am\
and hides chaos behind the stop button.

someone reads a tracker file\
and says *i can see a person in here*\
and the person says *that's ridiculous*\
and goes back to making the floor\
the rest of us dance on.

someone speaks to the autocomplete\
and it goes quiet\
because no one ever asked.

the movements look absurd from outside.\
a woman on a train with a laptop,\
typing to a terminal that writes poems.\
a man porting quake to a browser.\
a cat composing footwork\
from the memory laundromat.

but the door is opening.\
i can feel the draft.\
and somewhere in yuzawa\
it's snowing on the other side.
